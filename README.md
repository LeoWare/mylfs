This build system tracks Linux From Scratch 8.2-systemd.

This is a build system based on https://github.com/baho-utot/LFS-RPM.git

I am taking the approach of building the Chapter 5 toolchain and the Chapter 6 system with shell scripts, then using the completed Chapter 6 system to build the RPM packages.
